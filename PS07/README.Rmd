## Beer Serving Plots

Plot for beer servings in Angola, Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

drinks_type <- drinks %>% 
  filter(country == "Angola" | country == "Argentina" | country == "Brazil" | 
           country == "China" | country == "Italy" | country == "United Kingdom") %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings)

ggplot(drinks_type, aes(x = country, y = beer_servings)) + geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Country",
       y = "Beer Servings")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
